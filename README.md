Dispatch using google maps and text msg for PRS

We want to build a website that uses good maps api to find a location of a user and then send them a text msg saying they are in the area of a package that needs to be picked up with a link of a gps address to follow

We also want the user to be able to log into the website and find out where the closest package is available to pick up and get instructions and gps where to drop the package off.
